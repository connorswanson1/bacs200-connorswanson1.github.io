                <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                <p>Climate change is an issue that will eventually affect everybody. However, some groups of people
                    will be affected more harshly, and sooner. Those who live in coastal areas, especially areas that
                    are typically impacted by tropical storms, are already begining to see the effects. Hurricanes,
                    tsunamis, and other types of storms are getting more violent and more frequent. Not only do these
                    types of weather events create instant chaos and destruction, they leave lasting damage on entire
                    communities. Other changes to the climate, such as rising temperatures and rising ocean levels will
                    disproportionately harm certain groups of people. Those in poverty will be in greater danger
                    because of they lack the means to adjust with a changing climate. Although certain members of
                    society will be able to hold out longer against climte change, society as a whole will face the
                    consequences.

                <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                <p>Many of the factors driving the climate crisis are monetarily motivated. This is a big factor in the
                    massive divide in opions about the issue. Fossil fuels play a huge role in the worldwide economy.
                    However, studies show that fossil fuels also play a huge roll in climate change. When the industry
                    generates so much revenue and employs so many people, it is pretty hard to completley abandon the
                    practice and switch to completely renewable energy sources.
                </p>
                <p>However, if climate change continues to progress at the current rate, local economies
                    will be crumbled. Economies that thrive off of tourism will be severly hurt when natural attractions
                    are destroyed or become unmanagable. And outside of that, rural communities whose economy is built upon 
                    local crops and resources will be seriously affected when they can no longer use those resources or
                    grow those crops.

                <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                <p>Some of the most polarizing rifts in politics today come from the climate change debate.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Climate change is one of, if not the most pressing issues in the world today.
                    Although many still deny the existence of the issue, how can we deny the importance of the
                    state of the planet we live on? With no means to leave this planet in search of a better one, it
                    seems to be imperative that we take better care of our planet, especially for the sake of future
                    generations. However, an effort to take care of our planet, would have to be concerted. There is no
                    doubt that a push for renewable energy would greatly impact the economy and society as we know it.
                    But is there anything more worth saving, than the Earth itself?
