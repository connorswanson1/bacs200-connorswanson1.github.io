                    <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                    <p>Climate change is an issue that will eventually affect everybody. However, some groups of people
                        will be affected more harshly, and sooner. Those who live in coastal areas, especially areas
                        that are typically impacted by tropical storms, are already beginning to see the effects.
                        Hurricanes, tsunamis, and other types of storms are getting more violent and more frequent. Not
                        only do these types of weather events create instant chaos and destruction, but they also leave
                        lasting damage on entire communities. Other changes to the climate, such as rising temperatures
                        and rising ocean levels will disproportionately harm certain groups of people. Those in poverty
                        will be in greater danger because of they lack the means to adjust with a changing climate.
                        Although certain members of society will be able to hold out longer against climate change,
                        society will face the consequences.

                    <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                    <p>Many of the factors driving the climate crisis are monetarily motivated. This is a big factor in
                        the massive divide in opinions about the issue. Fossil fuels play a huge role in the worldwide
                        economy. However, studies show that fossil fuels also play a huge roll in climate change. When
                        the industry generates so much revenue and employs so many people, it is hard to completely
                        abandon the practice and switch to completely renewable energy sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, if climate change continues to progress at the current rate, local economies
                        will be crumbled. Economies that thrive off tourism will be severely hurt when natural
                        attractions are destroyed or become unmanageable. And outside of that, rural communities whose
                        economy is built upon local crops and resources will be seriously affected when they can no
                        longer use those resources or grow those crops.

                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <p>Some of the most polarizing rifts in politics today come from the climate change debate. In
                        general, left leaning politics tend to be on the side of trying to counteract climate change. A
                        study from the Pew Research Center showed many interesting differences when comparing democrats
                        and republicans on different climate change issues. Because of this clear divide, changing
                        policies and setting new precedent to slow climate change can be very difficult when political
                        parties cannot agree on what is really happening. Studies seem to show that liberals feel more
                        strongly about slowing down climate change, while conservatives show more skepticism towards the
                        science and scientists behind the research.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/bacs200/images/politicsOfCC.png" width="500" <BR CLEAR=”left” /> >
                    <p>Both political sides have truth within their positions. On the left side, it is provable that the
                        climate is changing. It is the logical step to want to fix this. On the right, it is valid to
                        consider how industry and economics will be affected by proposed changes. To enact real change,
                        politics will have to be set aside. Everyone, especially those with high positions of power,
                        need to work together to set forth effective policies and practice changes. The divide may
                        become more polarizing with changes enacted but the alternative is the collapse of our climate
                        as we know it.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Climate change is one of, if not the most pressing issues in the world today. Although many still
                        deny the existence of the issue, how can we deny the importance of the state of the planet we
                        live on? With no means to leave this planet in search of a better one, it seems to be imperative
                        that we take better care of our planet, especially for the sake of future generations. However,
                        an effort to take care of our planet, would have to be concerted. There is no doubt that a push
                        for renewable energy would greatly impact the economy and society as we know it. But is there
                        anything more worth saving, than the Earth itself?
