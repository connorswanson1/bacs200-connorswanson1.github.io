# My Story - Connor Swanson


## Why tell my story?

* Give my peers and mentors a better understanding of myself
* Hold myself accountable for my own truths
* Get honest and constructive feedback
* Build trust by disclosing myself

### Who are you?

* You are unique
* You are like everyone else
* Constant growth
* Personality —> Values —> Beliefs

### What is my "drama"?

* My biggest battle has always been with social anxiety. Over time, I have found lots of techniques that help me get through day to day life pretty well.
* Every strength is a weakness
* The destiny I see for myself is being happy and content with my choices and the people I surround myself with
* My greatest threat is the fear of taking chances. I do not want to miss out on oppurtunities because of this fear of the unfamiliar

## What will you leave?

* Everyone dies, but 
* Who will care?
* I want to be remembered for the way I treated people
* I am happy with the path I am on in life, but I feel comfort in the idea that I can change this path at any time

### What have I learned in each Life Stage?

* Youth: Treat people the way you want to be treated
* Young Adult
* Mid Life
* Senior
