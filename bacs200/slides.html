# My Story - Connor Swanson


## Why tell my story?

* Give my peers and mentors a better understanding of myself
* Hold myself accountable for my own truths
* Get honest and constructive feedback
* Build trust by disclosing myself

### Who are you?

* You are unique
* You are like everyone else
* Constant growth
* Personality —> Values —> Beliefs

### What is my "drama"?

* My biggest battle has always been with social anxiety. Over time, I have found lots of techniques that help me get through day to day life pretty well.
* All of my strengths are weaknesses and vice versa
* The destiny I see for myself is being happy and content with my choices and the people I surround myself with
* My greatest threat is the fear of taking chances. I do not want to miss out on oppurtunities because of this fear of the unfamiliar

## What will you leave?

* Everyone dies, but I'd like to make the most of the short time we get here
* Hopefully I will have a family and significant other of some kind to miss me when I am gone
* I want to be remembered for the way I treated people
* I am happy with the path I am on in life, but I feel comfort in the idea that I can change this path at any time

### What have I learned in each Life Stage?

* Youth: Treat people the way you want to be treated
* Young Adult: Every choice you make can have a lasting effect on your life. You have something to learn from every person you meet, every place you go and everything you do.
* Mid Life: Not here yet...
* Senior: Definitely not here yet!

## My Plan for Development in Computer Science

### Essential Skills

After I graduate in less than 2 years, I want to work as a Front End Developer
This takes an array of skills, like:
* TeamWork
* Adaptability
* Flexibility
* Perservearance
* Creativity

### Areas of Growth:

###Interview skills:
* Need to be able to think fast and on my feet in interview situations
* Be prepared for problems that will be asked to solve
* Prepare to get turned down and denied over and over

###Discovering new trends in CS:
* Must spend more time keeping up to date with the most current programing trends
* Learn new languages and concepts that people are talking about

###Expressing My Knowledge of Coding Through Conversation:
* I often feel like I am behind or am an imposter when hearing peers talking about Coding
* Need to ask more questions in class and with peers

### Quantified Learning initial-scale

* I am nearing the  "Proficient" level (1,000 hours). I estimate that the hours put into assignments throughout college and highschool, as well as personal projects put me close to that 1,000 hour mark.

### Growth Objective
* I want to put more hours of my time into programing for personal projects
* This shows a drive and love for coding that looks good in interviews, and I genuinely have a lot of things I would like to create
* I want to land a summer internship, I think this would give me a great boost and look into the tech world

### Building Development Time
* I want to put time in to perosnal projects over breaks from school
* I do not have enough time to balance school and work with personal programming projects, but I will over winter breaks and summer breaks
* I will try to put in 10-20 hours a week into developing my programming skills in my free time over extended breaks

### My Dreams
I have a few different Dreams
* I want to work for a company like Google, that is pushing the bounds of what is possible with computer science
* I want to have the means to research Artificial Intelligence when I have more knowledge and experience
* I want to teach programming after my career in the field. I have had so many amazing instructors, and would love to give this experience to young people in the future.
