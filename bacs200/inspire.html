    <h1>My Favorite Hero</h1>
    <p>One of my biggest inspirations is Dennis Rodman. Many people would consider
    this an interesting hero to have, but I think there is much to learn from him</p>
    <p>Dennis is easily my favorite basketball player ever. His unique playstyle and
     willingness to put his body on the line is something I admire. He was happy to
    grab 20 rebounds in a game and score 0 points, if it meant his team would win.</p>
    <p>But most of all, I love Rodman's ability to be himself. His iconic hairstyle is 
    something not many could pull off, and frankly no one else had the courage to try at the time.</p>
    <p>His clothing styles off the court were also iconic. It is so cool to see someone be so unafriad
    to be themselves. Being able to ignore what other people might is something that inspires me.
